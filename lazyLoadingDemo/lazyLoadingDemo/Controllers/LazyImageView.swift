/* Hey there I hope you enjoyed the session, as mentioned this code should only be used to understand the concept of lazy loading and to perform basic image caching you should not be using this in client projects

If the video was helpful then please feel free to share it with your iOS group and don't forget to like the video :)

 Feel free to ask questions on this topic I will be happy to answer them
